# AvvA - Smart Assistant Android
Project created for the [Gemini API Developer Competition](https://ai.google.dev/competition)

AvvA is an intelligent Android virtual assistant that uses artificial intelligence and context from **any screen** to help with tasks such as:
- Checking information
- Playing music
- Translating text
- Assisting with day-to-day tasks
- And much more!

The "main" branch contains the code submitted for analysis without any changes. To check out improvements and new functions, access the ["develop" branch](https://github.com/git-jr/AvvA/tree/develop) for now.
